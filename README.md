Clown is a CLI that:

* Helps with scaffolding a project
* Extending project configurations
* Ensuring that a project configurations are up to date

How does it do that? Mostly by copying files from one folder to another ðŸ¤¡

...but also by its ability to merge fragments of configuration files together.
